## Overview

**eSCAPE** is a parallel TIN-based landscape evolution model, built to simulate topography dynamic at various space and time scales. The model accounts for hillslope processes (soil creep using **linear** diffusion), fluvial incision (**stream power law**), spatially and temporally varying tectonics (vertical displacements) and climatic forces (temporal and spatial precipitation changes and/or sea-level fluctuations).

## Getting started

For installation information and documentation visit our github [**wiki page**](https://github.com/Geodels/eSCAPE/wiki) which provides a quick guide on the installation dependencies and or [**eSCAPE-model** website](https://escape-model.github.io).

A set of examples are available in the [eSCAPE-demo](https://github.com/Geodels/eSCAPE-demo) repository.

The easiest way to get started is with the Docker container
[https://hub.docker.com/u/geodels/](https://hub.docker.com/u/geodels/) using [Kitematic](https://docs.docker.com/kitematic/userguide/). Once **Kitematic** is installed on your computer, open it and look for **Geodels escape-docker** via the *search* menu.

If you want to install it yourself, you can follow the steps provided in the [wiki](https://github.com/Geodels/eSCAPE/wiki/Installation-on-HPC) page.

## The specs...

The model is based on the following approaches:
* an adaptation of the implicit, parallelizable method for calculating drainage area for both single (D8) and multiple flow direction (Dinf) from [**Richardson & Perron (2014)**](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2013WR014326),
* the extension of the parallel priority-flood algorithm from [**Barnes (2016)**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06204) to unstructured mesh,
* the methods developed in [**pyBadlands**](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands_serial) ([**Salles et al. (2018)**](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0195557)) for marine sedimentation.

### Docker

To use/test **eSCAPE** quickly, it is recommended to use the `Geodels escape-docker` image that is shipped with all the required libraries.

[https://hub.docker.com/u/geodels/](https://hub.docker.com/u/geodels/)

## Installation

Once the libraries mentioned above have been installed, **eSCAPE** will need to be cloned and compiled using the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Geodels/eSCAPE.git
python setup.py install
```

An example on how to install it on a _HPC server_ is provided in the [**wiki**](https://github.com/Geodels/eSCAPE/wiki/Installation-on-HPC) page.

## Tutorials

To get some additional info in regards to how to use **eSCAPE** a series of examples and tutorials is provided in the docker container (`escape-docker`) and is also available for  download from the [eSCAPE-demo](https://github.com/Geodels/eSCAPE-demo) repository.
